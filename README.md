### Hi! 👋🤗

I’m Matthias. I'm an independent UX designer and UI engineer, teacher, and occasional speaker. I teach Interface Prototyping at [Muthesius Academy of Fine Arts and Design](https://github.com/muthesius) and run [workshops on designing and prototyping](https://matthiasott.com/workshops). I publish the newsletter [Own Your Web](https://matthiasott.com/newsletter). On this account, I build a lot of prototypes, work on client projects, and a few (IndieWeb) side projects.

If you want to learn more or get in touch, visit my personal website and blog https://matthiasott.com or chat with me on Mastodon, where I’m <a rel="me" title="Matthias Ott on Mastodon" href="https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott">@matthiasott</a>.
