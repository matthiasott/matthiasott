### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤—

Iâ€™m Matthias. I'm an independent UX designer and UI engineer, teacher, and occasional speaker. I teach Interface Prototyping at [Muthesius Academy of Fine Arts and Design](https://github.com/muthesius) and run [workshops on designing and prototyping](https://matthiasott.com/workshops). Once a month, I publish the newsletter [Prototying.news](https://prototyping.news/). On this account, I build a lot of prototypes, work on client projects, and a few (IndieWeb) side projects.

If you want to learn more or get in touch, visit my personal website https://matthiasott.com
